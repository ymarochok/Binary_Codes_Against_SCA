# Full connected neural network in c
## Introduction
Goal of this network is to predict if there is anomaly in sequence of numbers.

Sequence consists of 10 floating poing numbers generated by sin function and noise, and then randomly injects anomaly, which this network will detect.

## Structure of this networks
Input layer consists of 10 neurons each represents one *feature*.
Hidden layer consists of 5 neurons.
Output is only one neuron which say yes or no. (yes if sequence have an anomaly and no if not).
